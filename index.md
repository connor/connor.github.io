# Hey there, I'm Connor.
{:.f2 .mv5 .lh-solid}

I'm an overly optimistic product <strike class="silver">engineer</strike> <strike class="silver">designer</strike> builder.

I [recently](https://twitter.com/Connor/status/1225782575114768384) left [Pinterest](https://www.pinterest.com/cnnr/) after a _wonderful_ 7&frac12; years.

During my time there, I helped rewrite the Web & iOS applications from scratch, shipped countless features to hundreds of millions of Pinners, was the first engineer in the New York City office, managed teams & led strategic cross-company R&D efforts (among other things).

Prior to withdrawing from school to join Pinterest, I was the first employee at [Lift](https://coach.me) (now Coach.me) & spent a summer interning at [Apple](https://apple.com).

I live in Kansas City with my [wife](https://linkedin.com/in/makressin/) & our [son](https://twitter.com/Connor/status/1161355210884812801). These days, watching after him is my primary [focus](https://twitter.com/Connor/status/1262745491936178184).

I'm active on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/connor), [GitHub](https://github.com/connor) & [Pinterest](https://pinterest.com/cnnr/). Or you can just send me a [note](mailto:c@cnnr.me?subject="Hello!").
