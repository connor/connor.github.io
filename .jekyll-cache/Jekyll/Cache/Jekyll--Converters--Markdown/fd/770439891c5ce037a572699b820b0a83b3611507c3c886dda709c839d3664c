<p>Iâ€™m an overly optimistic product <strike class="silver">engineer</strike> <strike class="silver">designer</strike> builder.</p>

<p>I <a href="https://twitter.com/Connor/status/1225782575114768384">recently</a> left <a href="https://www.pinterest.com/cnnr/">Pinterest</a> after a <em>wonderful</em> 7Â½ years.</p>

<p>During my time there, I helped rewrite the Web &amp; iOS applications from scratch, shipped countless features to hundreds of millions of Pinners, was the first engineer in the New York City office, managed teams &amp; led strategic cross-company R&amp;D efforts (among other things).</p>

<p>Prior to withdrawing from school to join Pinterest, I was the first employee at <a href="https://coach.me">Lift</a> (now Coach.me) &amp; spent a summer interning at <a href="https://apple.com">Apple</a>.</p>

<p>I live in Kansas City with my <a href="https://linkedin.com/in/makressin/">wife</a> &amp; our <a href="https://twitter.com/Connor/status/1161355210884812801">son</a>. These days, watching after him is my primary <a href="https://twitter.com/Connor/status/1262745491936178184">focus</a>.</p>

<p>Iâ€™m active on <a href="https://twitter.com/connor">Twitter</a>, <a href="https://github.com/connor">GitHub</a> &amp; <a href="https://pinterest.com/cnnr/">Pinterest</a>. Or you can just send me a <a href="mailto:c@cnnr.me?subject=&quot;Hello!&quot;">note</a>.</p>

<p>High five ğŸ–ğŸ»</p>
